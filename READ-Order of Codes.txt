
To run NetFLICS-CR architecture:
* originally created with Spyder in Anaconda Navigator suite. Keras and Tensorflow based.

1) First in code 'class_generator' set directory to 'example_train_data';
2) Run 'class_generator';
3) Open 'netflicscr_train_128_4_github' which is the main architecture code and set directory to save trained network. (h5py.File)
	- For network training 5100 samples are provided as example. Please note the NetFLICS-CR paper used 32000 samples for training
	and 8000 samples for validation.	
	- Define number of CR measurements to use (200 used as example, so 98.8% CR)
	- Define where to save trained network in log_dir variable.
4) Once network is trained try to reconstruct example data provided in "ExRPI128".
	- Run "netflicscr_recon_exp_128" code to obtain reconstructions.
	- Reconstructions saved in trained network folder created after 3) "trained_netflicscr_pat200"
